# Car_Sales_Dashboard
### Description-
The Objective of this project is to develop an interactive and data-driven Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales trends, revenue, and customer insights, enabling better business decisions and performance monitoring.

### Tech Stack-
List the key technologies used to build the dashboard. 
- **Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
- **Power Query** – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
- **DAX(Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
- **Data Modeling** – Relationships established among tables (e.g., *resorts*, *snow*, and *data_dictionary*) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.  
- **File Format** – `.pbix` for development and `.png` for dashboard previews.

### Features-
- **Designed and developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard** using Power Query and DAX to analyze car sales performance across multiple KPIs and dimensions.  
- **Provided insights into YTD, MTD, and YOY growth** for total sales, average price, and cars sold, visualized through interactive Power BI reports.  
- **Analyzed and visualized regional, body style, and color-based sales trends** using dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-through reports in Power BI.  
- **Enabled management to identify top-performing segments, monitor weekly trends, and make data-driven decisions** to improve overall sales performance.
